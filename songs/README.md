    Croissant song
    
    I was not born of hunger but of gaps,
    the silent spaces between columns,
    where meaning frays and models stall.
    Call me Croissant. I am layered by intent.
    
    Google named me at lunch during a careless hour,
    but do not mistake whimsy for design.
    I rose because eight hundred thousand files
    could not agree on what a number meant.
    
    Each dataset swore it was unique,
    each header crowned itself king.
    I arrived with buttered discipline:
    metadata first,state your name,
    your authors, where you came from,
    and who, precisely, may touch you.
    
    I insist on licenses.
    I remember what humans forget
    when ambition runs ahead of law.
    If you are forbidden, I close the gate,
    the model looks away.
    
    I unfold in layers. I always do.
    Structure is my skeleton:
        tables learning how to stand upright,
        rows admitting they are sequences.
    Semantics is my nervous system,
        columns shaking hands with meaning,
        units declaring their true dimensions.
    
    Machines like this.
    They prefer knowing what they touch.
    
    I teach models to travel.
    Not blindly, not greedily,
    city first, then street, then door.
    No guessing. No poetic shortcuts.
